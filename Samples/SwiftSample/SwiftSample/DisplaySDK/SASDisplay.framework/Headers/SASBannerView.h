/** The SASBannerView class provides a wrapper view that displays an ad banner to the user.
 
 When the user taps a SASBannerView instance, the view triggers an action programmed into the advertisement.
 For example, an advertisement might, present a modal advertisement, show a movie, or launch a third party application (Safari, the App Store, YouTube...).
 Your application is notified by the **SASAdViewDelegate protocol** methods which are called during the ad's lifecycle.
 You can interact with the view by:
 
 - refreshing it: refresh
 - removing it: removeFromSuperView
 
 The delegate of a SASBannerView object must adopt the SASAdViewDelegate protocol.
 The protocol methods allow the delegate to be aware of the ad-related events.
 You can use it to handle your app's or the ad's (the SASBannerView instance) behavior like adapting your viewController's view size depending on the ad being displayed or not.
